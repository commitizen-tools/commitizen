    empty commit messages by default, because they typically indicate to Git
    that the commit should be aborted.

  description: >
    Check all commit messages that are already on the current branch but not the
    default branch on the origin repository. Useful for checking messages after
    the fact (e.g., pre-push or in CI) without an expensive check of the entire
    repository history.
