## Create a new release with GitHub Actions

This guide shows you how to automatically bump versions, create changelogs, and publish releases using Commitizen in GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the workflow, you'll need:

1. A personal access token with repository write permissions
2. Commitizen configured in your project (see [configuration documentation](../config/configuration_file.md))

### Automatic version bumping

To automatically execute `cz bump` in your CI and push the new commit and tag back to your repository, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Create a personal access token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Commitizen CI")
4. Select the `repo` scope to grant full repository access
5. Click "Generate token" and **copy the token immediately** (you won't be able to see it again)

!!! warning "Important: Use Personal Access Token, not GITHUB_TOKEN"
    If you use `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, the workflow won't trigger another workflow run. This is a GitHub security feature to prevent infinite loops. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is treated like using `[skip ci]` in other CI systems.

#### Step 2: Add the token as a repository secret

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name it `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
5. Paste the token you copied in Step 1
6. Click "Add secret"

#### Step 3: Create the workflow file

Create a new file `.github/workflows/bumpversion.yml` in your repository with the following content:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/bumpversion.yml"
name: Bump version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # or 'main' if that's your default branch

jobs:
  bump-version:
    if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'bump:')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Bump version and create changelog with commitizen"
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          token: "${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}"
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Create bump and changelog
        uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

#### How it works

- **Trigger**: The workflow runs on every push to the `master` branch (or `main` if you change it)
- **Conditional check**: The `if` condition prevents infinite loops by skipping the job if the commit message starts with `bump:`
- **Checkout**: Uses your personal access token to check out the repository with full history (`fetch-depth: 0`)
- **Bump**: The `commitizen-action` automatically:
    - Determines the version increment based on your commit messages
    - Updates version files (as configured in your `pyproject.toml` or other config)
    - Creates a new git tag
    - Generates/updates the changelog
    - Pushes the commit and tag back to the repository

Once you push this workflow file to your repository, it will automatically run on the next push to your default branch.

### Creating a GitHub release

To automatically create a GitHub release when a new version is bumped, you can extend the workflow above.

The `commitizen-action` creates an environment variable called `REVISION` containing the newly created version. You can use this to create a release with the changelog content.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/bumpversion.yml"
name: Bump version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # or 'main' if that's your default branch

jobs:
  bump-version:
    if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'bump:')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Bump version and create changelog with commitizen"
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          token: "${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}"
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Create bump and changelog
        uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          changelog_increment_filename: body.md
      - name: Release
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          tag: v${{ env.REVISION }}
          bodyFile: "body.md"
          skipIfReleaseExists: true
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

You can find the complete workflow in our repository at [bumpversion.yml](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen/blob/master/.github/workflows/bumpversion.yml).

### Publishing a Python package

After a new version tag is created by the bump workflow, you can automatically publish your package to PyPI.

#### Step 1: Create a PyPI API token

1. Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
2. Scroll to the "API tokens" section
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
5. Set the scope (project-specific or account-wide)
6. Click "Add token" and **copy the token immediately**

!!! tip "Using trusted publishing (recommended)"
    Instead of API tokens, consider using [PyPI trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) with OpenID Connect (OIDC). This is more secure as it doesn't require storing secrets. The `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` action supports trusted publishing when you configure it in your PyPI project settings.

#### Step 2: Add the token as a repository secret

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name it `PYPI_PASSWORD`
5. Paste the PyPI token
6. Click "Add secret"

#### Step 3: Create the publish workflow

Create a new file `.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml` that triggers on tag pushes:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml"
name: Upload Python Package

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"  # Will trigger for every tag, alternative: 'v*'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"
      - name: Install Poetry
        uses: snok/install-poetry@v1
        with:
          version: latest
          virtualenvs-in-project: true
          virtualenvs-create: true
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          poetry --version
          poetry install
      - name: Build and publish
        env:
          POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_PYPI_USERNAME: __token__
          POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_PYPI_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
        run: poetry publish --build
```

This workflow uses Poetry to build and publish the package. You can find the complete workflow in our repository at [pythonpublish.yml](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen/blob/master/.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml).

!!! note "Alternative publishing methods"
    You can also use [pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish) or other build tools like `setuptools`, `flit`, or `hatchling` to publish your package.
