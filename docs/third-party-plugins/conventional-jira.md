# [Conventional JIRA](https://pypi.org/project/conventional-JIRA/)

Just like _conventional commit_ format, but the scope has been restricted to a
JIRA issue format, i.e. `project-issueNumber`. This standardises scopes in a
meaningful way.

<!-- TODO: What features does the plugin provide? -->

## Installation

```sh
pip install conventional-JIRA
```
