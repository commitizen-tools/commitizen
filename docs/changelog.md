## About

This command will generate a changelog following the committing rules established.

## Usage

```bash
$ cz changelog --help
usage: cz changelog [-h] [--dry-run] [--file-name FILE_NAME]
                    [--unreleased-version UNRELEASED_VERSION] [--incremental]
                    [--start-rev START_REV]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dry-run             show changelog to stdout
  --file-name FILE_NAME
                        file name of changelog (default: 'CHANGELOG.md')
  --unreleased-version UNRELEASED_VERSION
                        set the value for the new version (use the tag value),
                        instead of using unreleased
  --incremental         generates changelog from last created version, useful
                        if the changelog has been manually modified
  --start-rev START_REV
                        start rev of the changelog.If not set, it will
                        generate changelog from the start
```

### Examples

```bash
cz changelog
```

```bash
cz ch
```

## Constrains

changelog generation is constrained only to **markdown** files.

## Description

These are the variables used by the changelog generator.

```md
# <version> (<date>)

## <change_type>

- **<scope>**: <message>
```

It will create a full block like above per version found in the tags.
And it will create a list of the commits found.
The `change_type` and the `scope` are optional, they don't need to be provided,
but if your regex does they will be rendered.

The format followed by the changelog is the one from [keep a changelog][keepachangelog]
and the following variables are expected:

| Variable      | Description                                                                                    | Source         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `version`     | Version number which should follow [semver][semver]                                            | `tags`         |
| `date`        | Date in which the tag was created                                                              | `tags`         |
| `change_type` | The group where the commit belongs to, this is optional. Example: fix                          | `commit regex` |
| `message`\*   | Information extracted from the commit message                                                  | `commit regex` |
| `scope`       | Contextual information. Should be parsed using the regex from the message, it will be **bold** | `commit regex` |
| `breaking`    | Whether is a breaking change or not                                                             | `commit regex` |

- **required**: is the only one required to be parsed by the regex

## Configuration

### `unreleased_version`

There is usually an egg and chicken situation when automatically
bumping the version and creating the changelog.
If you bump the version first, you have no changelog, you have to
create it later, and it won't be included in
the release of the created version.

If you create the changelog before bumping the version, then you
usually don't have the latest tag, and the _Unreleased_ title appears.

By introducing `unreleased_version` you can prevent this situation.

Before bumping you can run:

```bash
cz changelog --unreleased_version="v1.0.0"
```

Remember to use the tag instead of the raw version number

For example if the format of your tag includes a `v` (`v1.0.0`), then you should use that,
if your tag is the same as the raw version, then ignore this.

Alternatively you can directly bump the version and create the changelog by doing

```bash
cz bump --changelog
```

### `file-name`

This value can be updated in the `toml` file with the key `changelog_file` under `tools.commitizen`

Specify the name of the output file, remember that changelog only works with markdown.

```bash
cz changelog --file-name="CHANGES.md"
```

### `incremental`

This flag can be set in the `toml` file with the key `changelog_incremental` under `tools.commitizen`

Benefits:

- Build from latest version found in changelog, this is useful if you have a different changelog and want to use commitizen
- Update unreleased area
- Allows users to manually touch the changelog without being rewritten.

```bash
cz changelog --incremental
```

```toml
[tools.commitizen]
# ...
changelog_incremental = true
```

### `start-rev`

This value can be set in the `toml` file with the key `changelog_start_rev` under `tools.commitizen`

Start from a given git rev to generate the changelog. Commits before that rev will not be considered. This is especially useful for long-running projects adopting conventional commits, where old commit messages might fail to be parsed for changelog generation.

```bash
cz changelog --start-rev="v0.2.0"
```

```toml
[tools.commitizen]
# ...
changelog_start_rev = "v0.2.0"
```

## Hooks

Supported hook methods:

- per parsed message: useful to add links
- end of changelog generation: useful to send slack or chat message, or notify another department
