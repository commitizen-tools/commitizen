# Changelog Options

<!-- When adding a new option, please keep the alphabetical order. -->
<!-- If there is a new configuration option that doesn't have a corresponding command line option, please add it here. -->

As for now, each of the options that is used by `cz changelog` command can correlate to a command line option.

See [changelog command line options](../commands/changelog.md#command-line-options) for more details.
