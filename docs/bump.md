![Bump version](images/bump.gif)

## About

The version is bumped **automatically** based on the commits.

The commits should follow the rules of the committer to be parsed correctly.

It is possible to specify a **prerelease** (alpha, beta, release candidate) version.

The version can also be **manually** bumped.

The version format follows [semantic versioning][semver].

This means `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Increment | Description                 | Conventional commit map |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `MAJOR`   | Breaking changes introduced | `BREAKING CHANGE`       |
| `MINOR`   | New features                | `feat`                  |
| `PATCH`   | Fixes                       | `fix` + everything else |

Prereleases are supported following python's [PEP 0440][pep440]

The scheme of this format is

```bash
[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]
```

Some examples:

```bash
0.9.0
0.9.1
0.9.2
0.9.10
0.9.11
1.0.0a0  # alpha
1.0.0a1
1.0.0b0  # beta
1.0.0rc0 # release candidate
1.0.0rc1
1.0.0
1.0.1
1.1.0
2.0.0
2.0.1a
```

`post` and `dev` releases are not supported yet.

## Usage

```bash
$ cz bump --help
usage: cz bump [-h] [--dry-run] [--files-only] [--changelog] [--no-verify] [--local-version]
               [--yes] [--tag-format TAG_FORMAT] [--bump-message BUMP_MESSAGE]

               [--increment {MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH}] [--check-consistency] [--annotated-tag]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dry-run             show output to stdout, no commit, no modified files
  --files-only          bump version in the files from the config
  --changelog, -ch      generate the changelog for the newest version
  --no-verify           this option bypasses the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
  --yes                 accept automatically questions done
  --local-version       bump the local portion of the version
  --tag-format TAG_FORMAT
                        the format used to tag the commit and read it, use it in existing projects, wrap
                        around simple quotes
  --bump-message BUMP_MESSAGE
                        template used to create the release commit, useful when working with CI
  --prerelease {alpha,beta,rc}, -pr {alpha,beta,rc}
                        choose type of prerelease
  --increment {MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH}
                        manually specify the desired increment
  --check-consistency, -cc
                        check consistency among versions defined in commitizen configuration and
                        version_files
  --annotated-tag, -at  create annotated tag instead of lightweight one
```

### `--files-only`

Bumps the version in the files defined in `version_files` without creating a commit and tag on the git repository,

```bash
cz bump --files-only
```

### `--changelog`

Generate a **changelog** along with the new version and tag when bumping.

```bash
cz bump --changelog
```

### `--check-consistency`

Check whether the versions defined in `version_files` and the version in commitizen
configuration are consistent before bumping version.

```bash
cz bump --check-consistency
```

For example, if we have `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
version = "1.21.0"
version_files = [
    "src/__version__.py",
    "setup.py",
]
```

`src/__version__.py`,

```python
__version__ = "1.21.0"
```

and `setup.py`.

```python
...
    version="1.0.5"
...
```

If `--check-consistency` is used, commitizen will check whether the current version in `pyproject.toml`
exists in all version_files and find out it does not exist in `setup.py` and fails.
However, it will still update `pyproject.toml` and `src/__version__.py`.

To fix it, you'll first `git checkout .` to reset to the status before trying to bump and update
the version in `setup.py` to `1.21.0`

### `--local-version`

Bump the local portion of the version.

```bash
cz bump --local-version
```

For example, if we have `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
version = "5.3.5+0.1.0"
```

If `--local-version` is used, it will bump only the local version `0.1.0` and keep the public version `5.3.5` intact, bumping to the version `5.3.5+0.2.0`.

### `--annotated-tag`

If `--annotated-tag` is used, commitizen will create annotated tags. Also available via configuration, in `pyproject.toml` or `.cz.toml`.

### `--changelog-to-stdout`

If `--changelog-to-stdout` is used, the incremental changelog generated by the bump
will be sent to the stdout, and any other message generated by the bump will be
sent to stderr.

If `--changelog` is not used with this command, it is still smart enough to
understand that the user wants to create a changelog. It is recommened to be
explicit and use `--changelog` (or the setting `update_changelog_on_bump`).

This command is useful to "transport" the newly created changelog.
It can be sent to an auditing system, or to create a Github Release.

Example:

```bash
cz bump --changelog --changelog-to-stdout > body.md
```

## Configuration

### `tag_format`

The `tag_format` is used to parse the format from the git tags and to generate new tags.

Commitizen defaults to the standard Semver format (`$version`) or can be customized using a predefined set of variables.

```bash
cz bump --tag-format="v$version"
```

```bash
cz bump --tag-format="v$major.$minor.$patch$prerelease"
```

In your `pyproject.toml` or `.cz.toml`

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
tag_format = "v$major.$minor.$patch$prerelease"
```

#### Standard SemVer Variables

The SemVer variables must be preceded by a `$` sign.

Supported variables:

| Variable      | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `$version`    | full generated version                     |
| `$major`      | MAJOR increment                            |
| `$minor`      | MINOR increment                            |
| `$patch`      | PATCH increment                            |
| `$prerelease` | Prerelase (alpha, beta, release candidate) |

#### CalVer Variables

Commitizen also supports [CalVer](https://calver.org/) in any combination with or without SemVer; however, using standard CalVer formats is recommended for interoperability with other tools. Common CalVer `tag_format`'s include `%Y.%m` or `%y.%m.%d`.

If a unique build number is desired, this could either be implemented by incrementing the string in the configuration file with whatever build tool is used (i.e. `%Y.%m.123` to `%Y.%m.124`) or by mapping all commit types to one SemVer component through the `bump_map` configuration and a `tag_format` of `"%Y.%m.$major`.

```bash
cz bump --tag-format="%y.%-m.%-d$prerelease"
cz bump --tag-format="%Y.%m.$major.$prerelease"
cz bump --tag-format="%Y.%m.$version"
```

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
tag_format = "%Y.%m.%d$prerelease"
```

The full `strftime` formatting options are supported. Below are the most common for CalVer. For a full list, see: [https://strftime.org/](https://strftime.org/)

| Code  | Description                                                | Example       |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `%y`  | Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number.      | 08 (for 2008) |
| `%Y`  | Year with century as a decimal number.                     | 2008          |
| `$m`  | Month as a zero-padded decimal number.                     | 01 (for Jan)  |
| `$-m` | Month as a decimal number. (Platform specific)             | 1 (for Jan)   |
| `$d`  | Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.          | 05            |
| `$-d` | Day of the month as a decimal number. (Platform specific)  | 5             |

### `version_files` \*

It is used to identify the files which should be updated with the new version.
It is also possible to provide a pattern for each file, separated by colons (`:`).

Commitizen will update it's configuration file automatically (`pyproject.toml`, `.cz`) when bumping,
regarding if the file is present or not in `version_files`.

\* Renamed from `files` to `version_files`.

Some examples

`pyproject.toml` or `.cz.toml`

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
version_files = [
    "src/__version__.py",
    "setup.py:version"
]
```

In the example above, we can see the reference `"setup.py:version"`.
This means that it will find a file `setup.py` and will only make a change
in a line containing the `version` substring.

---

### `bump_message`

Template used to specify the commit message generated when bumping.

defaults to: `bump: version $current_version → $new_version`

| Variable           | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `$current_version` | the version existing before bumping |
| `$new_version`     | version generated after bumping     |

Some examples

`pyproject.toml` or `.cz.toml`

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
bump_message = "release $current_version → $new_version [skip-ci]"
```

---

### `update_changelog_on_bump`

When set to `true` the changelog is always updated incrementally when running `cz bump`, so the user does not have to provide the `--changelog` flag every time.

defaults to: `false`

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
update_changelog_on_bump = true
```

---

### `annotated_tag`

When set to `true` commitizen will create annotated tags.

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
annotated_tag = true
```
