Customize in configuration file This is only supported when configuring through toml (e.g., pyproject.toml , .cz , and .cz.toml ) The basic steps are: Define your custom committing or bumping rules in the configuration file. Declare name = \"cz_customize\" in your configuration file, or add -n cz_customize when running commitizen. Example: [tool.commitizen] name = \"cz_customize\" [tool.commitizen.customize] message_template = \"{{change_type}}:{% if show_message %} {{message}}{% endif %}\" example = \"feature: this feature enable customize through config file\" schema = \"<type>: <body>\" bump_pattern = \"^(break|new|fix|hotfix)\" bump_map = { \"break\" = \"MAJOR\" , \"new\" = \"MINOR\" , \"fix\" = \"PATCH\" , \"hotfix\" = \"PATCH\" } info_path = \"cz_customize_info.txt\" info = \"\"\" This is customized info \"\"\" [[tool.commitizen.customize.questions]] type = \"list\" name = \"change_type\" choices = [{value = \"feature\", name = \"feature: A new feature.\"}, {value = \"bug fix\", name = \"bug fix: A bug fix.\"}] # choices = [\"feature\", \"fix\"] # short version message = \"Select the type of change you are committing\" [[tool.commitizen.customize.questions]] type = \"input\" name = \"message\" message = \"Body.\" [[tool.commitizen.customize.questions]] type = \"confirm\" name = \"show_message\" message = \"Do you want to add body message in commit?\" Customize configuration Parameter Type Default Description questions dict None Questions regarding the commit message. Detailed below. message_template str None The template for generating message from the given answers. message_template should either follow the string.Template or Jinja2 formatting specification, and all the variables in this template should be defined in name in questions . Note that Jinja2 is not installed by default. If not installed, commitizen will use string.Template formatting. example str None (OPTIONAL) Provide an example to help understand the style. Used by cz example . schema str None (OPTIONAL) Show the schema used. Used by cz schema . info_path str None (OPTIONAL) The path to the file that contains explanation of the commit rules.

Valid type: list , input and etc. See More name str None The key for the value answered by user. It's used in message_template message str None Detail description for the question. choices list None (OPTIONAL) The choices when type = list . Either use a list of values or a list of dicitionaries with name and value keys. See examples above. default Any None (OPTIONAL) The default value for this question. filter str None (Optional) Validator for user's answer. (Work in Progress) 2. Customize through customizing a class The basic steps are: Inheriting from BaseCommitizen Give a name to your rules. Expose the class at the end of your file assigning it to discover_this Create a python package starting with cz_ using setup.py , poetry , etc Check an example on how to configure BaseCommitizen . You can also automate the steps above through cookiecutter . cookiecutter gh:commitizen-tools/commitizen_cz_template See commitizen_cz_template for detail. Custom commit rules Create a file starting with cz_ , for example cz_jira.py . This prefix is used to detect the plug-in. Same method flask uses Inherit from BaseCommitizen , and you must define questions and message . The others are optional. from commitizen.cz.base import BaseCommitizen class JiraCz ( BaseCommitizen ): def questions ( self ) -> list : \"\"\"Questions regarding the commit message.\"\"\" questions = [ { 'type' : 'input' , 'name' : 'title' , 'message' : 'Commit title' }, { 'type' : 'input' , 'name' : 'issue' , 'message' : 'Jira Issue number:' }, ] return questions def message ( self , answers : dict ) -> str : \"\"\"Generate the message with the given answers.\"\"\" return ' {0} (# {1} )' . format ( answers [ 'title' ], answers [ 'issue' ]) def example ( self ) -> str : \"\"\"Provide an example to help understand the style (OPTIONAL) Used by `cz example`. \"\"\" return 'Problem with user (#321)' def schema ( self ) -> str : \"\"\"Show the schema used (OPTIONAL) Used by `cz schema`. \"\"\" return '<title> (<issue>)' def info ( self ) -> str : \"\"\"Explanation of the commit rules. (OPTIONAL) Used by `cz info`. \"\"\" return 'We use this because is useful' discover_this = JiraCz # used by the plug-in system The next file required is setup.py modified from flask version. from setuptools import setup setup ( name = 'JiraCommitizen' , version = '0.1.0' , py_modules = [ 'cz_jira' ], license = 'MIT' , long_description = 'this is a long description' , install_requires = [ 'commitizen' ] ) So in the end, we would have . \u251c\u2500\u2500 cz_jira.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.py And that's it. You can install it without uploading to pypi by simply doing pip install . If you feel like it should be part of this repo, create a PR. Custom bump rules You need to define 2 parameters inside your custom BaseCommitizen . Parameter Type Default Description bump_pattern str None Regex to extract information from commit (subject and body) bump_map dict None Dictionary mapping the extracted information to a SemVer increment type ( MAJOR , MINOR , PATCH ) Let's see an example. from commitizen.cz.base import BaseCommitizen class StrangeCommitizen ( BaseCommitizen ): bump_pattern = r \"^(break|new|fix|hotfix)\" bump_map = { \"break\" : \"MAJOR\" , \"new\" : \"MINOR\" , \"fix\" : \"PATCH\" , \"hotfix\" : \"PATCH\" } That's it, your commitizen now supports custom rules, and you can run. cz -n cz_strange bump Custom changelog generator The changelog generator should just work in a very basic manner without touching anything. You can customize it of course, and this are the variables you need to add to your custom BaseCommitizen . Parameter Type Required Description commit_parser str NO Regex which should provide the variables explained in the changelog description changelog_pattern str NO Regex to validate the commits, this is useful to skip commits that don't meet your rulling standards like a Merge.

Goal : Bump a new version every time that a change occurs on the master branch. The bump should be executed automatically by the CI process. Development Workflow: A developer creates a new commit on any branch (except master ) A developer creates a merge request (MR) against master branch When the MR is merged into master, the 2 stages of the CI are executed For simplification, we store the software version in a file called VERSION . You can use any file that you want as commitizen supports it. The commit message executed automatically by the CI must include [skip-ci] in the message; otherwise, the process will generate a loop. You can define the message structure in commitizen as well. Gitlab Configuration: To be able to change files and push new changes with Gitlab CI runners, we need to have a ssh key and configure a git user. First, let's create a ssh key . The only requirement is to create it without a passphrase: ssh-keygen -f deploy_key -N \"\" The previous command will create a private and public key under the files deploy_key and deploy_key.pub . We will use them later. For the git user, we need an email and username. You can choose whatever you want; in this example, we choose ci-runner@myproject.com and admin , respectively. Now, we need to create three environment variables that will be visible for the runners. They should be created in the variables section under settings/ci_cd : Create SSH_PRIVATE_KEY , CI_EMAIL , CI_USERNAME variables, and fill them with the private_key , email and username that we have created previously. The latest step is to create a deploy key. To do this, we should create it under the section settings/repository and fill it with the public key generated before. Check Write access allowed ; otherwise, the runner won't be able to write the changes to the repository. If you have more projects under the same organization, you can reuse the deploy key created before, but you will have to repeat the step where we have created the environment variables (ssh key, email, and username). tip: If the CI raise some errors, try to unprotected the private key. Defining GitLab CI Pipeline Create a .gitlab-ci.yaml file that contains stages and jobs configurations. You can find more info here . Define stages and jobs . For this example, we define two stages with one job each one. Test the application. Auto bump the version. This means changing the file/s that reflects the version, creating a new commit and git tag. Stages and Jobs image : docker:latest services : - docker:dind variables : API_IMAGE_NAME : $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME before_script : - apk add --no-cache py-pip - pip install docker-compose stages : - test - auto-bump test : stage : test script : - docker-compose run -e DJANGO_ENVIRONMENT=dev your_project python manage.py test # run tests auto-bump : stage : auto-bump image : python:3.6 before_script : - 'which ssh-agent || ( apt-get update -qy && apt-get install openssh-client -qqy )' - eval `ssh-agent -s` - echo \"${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}\" | tr -d '\\r' | ssh-add - > /dev/null # add ssh key - pip3 install -U Commitizen # install commitizen - mkdir -p ~/.ssh - chmod 700 ~/.ssh - echo \"$SSH_PUBLIC_KEY\" >> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - '[[ -f /.dockerenv ]] && echo -e \"Host *\\n\\tStrictHostKeyChecking no\\n\\n\" > ~/.ssh/config' dependencies : - test script : - git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:discover/rentee-core.git # git configuration - git config --global user.email \"${CI_EMAIL}\" && git config --global user.name \"${CI_USERNAME}\" - 'exists=`git show-ref refs/heads/master` && if [ -n \"$exists\" ]; then git branch -D master; fi' - git checkout -b master - cz bump # execute auto bump and push to master - git push origin master:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME - TAG=$(head -n 1 VERSION) # get the new software version and save into artifacts - echo \"#!/bin/sh\" >> variables - echo \"export TAG='$TAG'\" >> variables - git push origin $TAG only : refs : - master artifacts : paths : - variables So, every time that a developer push to any branch, the test job is executed.

Conventional commits If you are using conventional commits , the most important thing to know is that you must begin your commits with at least one of these tags: fix , feat . And if you introduce a breaking change, then, you must add to your commit body the following BREAKING CHANGE . Using these 3 keywords will allow the proper identification of the semantic version. Of course, there are other keywords, but I'll leave it to the reader to explore them.
